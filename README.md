_"Weaving Knowledge, Driving Exploration."_
  BioNova is a platform designed to make NASAâ€™s space biology research accessible, searchable, and easy to explore. Space biology experiments have generated decades of invaluable data about how plants, microbes, animals, and humans respond to conditions like microgravity, radiation, and isolation. However, this information is often scattered across publications, databases, and mission reports, making it difficult to access and interpret. BioNova bridges this gap by allowing users to search for any biological keyword and instantly access structured, organized, and summarized information from NASAâ€™s bioscience datasets.

###Problem Statement
As humanity prepares to embark on a new era of space exploration â€” returning to the Moon and setting its sights on Mars â€” understanding how life responds and adapts to space environments is more critical than ever. Over the past decades, NASA has conducted countless biological experiments aboard space missions, generating a vast body of scientific knowledge. These findings hold essential clues to sustaining human life beyond Earth â€” from maintaining astronaut health to growing food and developing resilient life-support systems.

However, despite being publicly available, this knowledge is scattered across numerous scientific publications, mission reports, and databases, making it difficult for researchers, educators, and innovators to find relevant information quickly. The lack of a unified, user-friendly way to search, interpret, and connect this data limits how effectively it can be used to advance future missions and scientific breakthroughs.

###Problem Solution
Our project, BioNova, addresses this challenge by creating a dynamic, web platform that brings NASAâ€™s space biology knowledge into one intuitive and accessible space. The platform allows users to enter a keyword or topic and instantly explore related bioscience publications, experiment results, and mission details. Using tools like artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs, BioNova summarizes complex research into concise insights and interactive visualizations, enabling users to understand impacts and relationships at a glance.
By transforming scattered data into an organized, searchable knowledge engine, BioNova accelerates discovery, supports mission planning, and empowers scientists, students, and innovators to build the biological foundations for humanityâ€™s future in space.
